# ImageRetrieval

A Jupyter Notebook–based project for building an image retrieval system using deep learning techniques.

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end image retrieval pipeline. It includes image preprocessing, feature extraction via a deep learning model, and a similarity search mechanism to find visually similar images from a dataset. The system is integrated with an interactive **Gradio** interface for ease of use.

---

## Repository Structure

- `Image_Retrieval_Project.ipynb` – Main Jupyter Notebook containing the complete workflow.
- `images/` – Example image dataset for testing and demonstration.
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies for running the project.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `tensorflow` or `torch` (depending on implementation)
  - `gradio`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `opencv-python`

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harshmange007/ImageRetrieval.git
   cd ImageRetrieval
   ```

2. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Image_Retrieval_Project.ipynb
   ```

3. Run through the notebook cells to:
   - Load and preprocess image dataset
   - Extract image embeddings using a CNN model
   - Store embeddings for retrieval
   - Implement similarity search (cosine similarity / Euclidean distance)
   - Launch a **Gradio** UI for interactive retrieval

---

## Features

- **Image Preprocessing** — Standardization, resizing, and normalization for model input.
- **Feature Extraction** — Leverages deep learning models for robust visual representation.
- **Similarity Search** — Finds visually similar images based on embedding similarity.
- **Interactive UI** — Gradio-powered interface to search and retrieve images in real-time.

## How to Adapt

- Replace the `images/` folder with your own dataset.
- Experiment with different CNN architectures (ResNet, EfficientNet, etc.).
- Fine-tune model parameters to improve retrieval accuracy.
- Extend similarity search to use Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) for faster retrieval.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for multi-modal retrieval (image + text queries).
- Integrate ANN search libraries like FAISS or Milvus.
- Deploy as a web app using Streamlit or Flask.
- Optimize performance for large-scale datasets.

## Summary

This project is a practical guide to building an image retrieval system from scratch, demonstrating both the machine learning and deployment aspects. The clean and modular workflow makes it easy to adapt for other datasets or retrieval tasks.
